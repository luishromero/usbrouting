## USB ROUTE FINDER

This tool allows the [Sim√≥n Bolivar University's](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidad_Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar_(Venezuela)) Students to find the best route inside the campus to go from one point to other. It is very useful to new students who are not familiarized with the location of the buildings inside de campus.

This app was inspired by the solution proposed by [thegisdev](https://github.com/thegisdev/leaflet-pgrouting-geoserver).
